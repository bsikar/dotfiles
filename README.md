# Ansible Dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles that I manage with Ansible. They include configurations for various applications such as Vim, Zsh, and Tmux, as well as system-wide configurations.

## Installation

To install, first run the bootstrap script:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./install.bash
```

Then select a theme if you want one

```
git checkout green
./install.bash
```
