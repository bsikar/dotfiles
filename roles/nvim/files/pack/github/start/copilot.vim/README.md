# Copilot.vim

GitHub Copilot uses OpenAI Codex to suggest code and entire functions in
real-time right from your editor. Trained on billions of lines of public code,
GitHub Copilot turns natural language prompts including comments and method
names into coding suggestions across dozens of languages.

Copilot.vim is a Vim plugin for GitHub Copilot.  For now, it requires Neovim
0.6 (for virtual lines support) and a Node.js installation.

## Subscription

Once GitHub Copilot is generally available, it will require a subscription. It
will be free for verified students and maintainers of popular open source
projects on GitHub.

## Getting started

    plugin manager.  Or to install directly:
